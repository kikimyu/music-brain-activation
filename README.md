This project is the home / final assignment for the "Programming for Psychologists" course from the Master's "Cognitive Neuropsychology" at the VU, Amsterdam. It contains Python code written to visualize MRI data, which was taken from Neurosynth (see link above). For this particular project, I visualized the association of the concept "Music" in the brain.
